      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm a passionate software developer on a journey to master programming and build
        powerful digital experiences. From writing smart contracts for <strong>CoinWryt</strong>,
        a tokenized storytelling platform, to integrating geolocation and facial recognition in
        <strong>Smart Attend</strong>, I love combining logic and creativity to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        I specialize in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong>,
        and <strong>Node.js</strong>, and I deploy my projects using platforms like <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>,
        <strong>Netlify</strong>, and <strong>Vercel</strong>. My goal is to become a full-stack developer
        and continue building decentralized applications, AI integrations, and more.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I'm a car enthusiast—my dream machine is the <strong>Porsche 911</strong>.
        I'm also a fan of the <strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT)</strong>, and I'm working on
        a concept that merges their world with custom car culture. Creativity fuels my code!
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Whether I’m building front-end interfaces in Figma or deploying smart contract-enabled dApps,
        I’m always learning and evolving. I believe in practical skills, consistent growth, and creating
        meaningful tools for people.
      </p>
  
      <p><em>Let’s build something extraordinary together.</em></p>
